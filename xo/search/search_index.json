The transitions from a command-based interface to a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to a Conversational User Interface (CUI) became natural and need-based, making communication easier.</p> <p>Further enhancements facilitated the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that can process natural language (NLP). In turn, AI has contributed to Conversational Virtual Assistants that understand human communication, derive a task from this understanding and extract the information they require in order to execute this task.</p> <p>AI-driven, NLP-based chat, and voice Conversational Virtual Assistants are the latest in technology and a must for contemporary enterprises.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"virtual-assistants-overview/#what-are-conversational-assistants","title":"What are Conversational Assistants?","text":"<p>A Conversational Virtual Assistant (VA) acts as an intelligent intermediary between people, digital systems, and internet-enabled things.

The main task of the Conversational VA is to analyze the utterance and extract the intent, and entities essential to carry a conversation. </p> <p>An Intent is the user\u2019s intention and usually comes in the form of a verb or noun within the user's utterance.</p> <p>Entities are a collection of data or information that the VA requires to complete the task which is identified in the user intent. They can be fields, data or words that the developer designates as necessary for the VA to complete a task. Entities can either be part of a user utterance, but the VA might also need to prompt the user to provide them. An Entity can be of any type; for instance: name, location, date, time, etc.</p> <p>For example, let us consider the following message that a user sends to the Virtual Assistant: </p> <p>I want to fly to London this weekend.</p> <ul> <li>The entire sentence represents the Utterance;</li> <li>\u201cI want to fly\u201d is the Intent;</li> <li>\u201cLondon\u201d and \u201cthis weekend\u201d form the values for the Entities representing \u201cDestination\u201d and \u201cTravel Date\u201d respectively.

This leads to a significant reduction in size, fewer bytes to     transfer, and a smaller search index.</p> </li> <li> <p>Some structure is preserved: each section of the search index includes     a small subset of HTML to provide the necessary structure to allow for more     sophisticated search previews. Revisiting our example from before, let's     look at an excerpt:</p> NowBefore <pre><code>\u2026 links, or even &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (isAwesome){ \u2026 }\\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n</code></pre> <pre><code>\u2026 links , or even code : if (isAwesome) { \u2026 }\n</code></pre> <p>The punctuation issue is gone, as no additional whitespace is inserted, and the preserved markup yields additional context to make scanning search results more effective.</p> </li> </ol> <p>On to the next step in the process: tokenization.</p>"},{"location":"blog/posts/search-better-faster-smaller/#tokenizer-lookahead","title":"Tokenizer lookahead","text":"<p>The default tokenizer of lunr uses a regular expression to split a given string by matching each character against the <code>separator</code> as defined in <code>mkdocs.yml</code>. This doesn't allow for more complex separators based on lookahead or multiple characters.</p> <p>Fortunately, our new search implementation provides an advanced tokenizer that doesn't have these shortcomings and supports more complex regular expressions. As a result, Material for MkDocs just changed its own separator configuration to the following value:</p> <pre><code>[\\s\\-,:!=\\[\\]()\"/]+|(?!\\b)(?=[A-Z][a-z])|\\.(?!\\d)|&amp;[lg]t;\n</code></pre> <p>While the first part up to the first <code>|</code> contains a list of single control characters at which the string should be split, the following three sections explain the remainder of the regular expression.4</p>"},{"location":"blog/posts/search-better-faster-smaller/#case-changes","title":"Case changes","text":"<p>Many programming languages use <code>PascalCase</code> or <code>camelCase</code> naming conventions. When a user searches for the term <code>case</code>, it's quite natural to expect for <code>PascalCase</code> and <code>camelCase</code> to show up. By adding the following match group to the separator, this can now be achieved with ease:</p> <pre><code>(?!\\b)(?=[A-Z][a-z])\n</code></pre> <p>This regular expression is a combination of a negative lookahead (<code>\\b</code>, i.e., not a word boundary) and a positive lookahead (<code>[A-Z][a-z]</code>, i.e., an uppercase character followed by a lowercase character), and has the following behavior:</p> <ul> <li><code>PascalCase</code> <code>Pascal</code>, <code>Case</code></li> <li><code>camelCase</code> <code>camel</code>, <code>Case</code></li> <li><code>UPPERCASE</code> <code>UPPERCASE</code></li> </ul> <p>Searching for  searchHighlight now brings up the section discussing the <code>search.highlight</code> feature flag, which also demonstrates that this now even works properly for search queries.5</p>"},{"location":"blog/posts/search-better-faster-smaller/#version-numbers","title":"Version numbers","text":"<p>Indexing version numbers is another problem that can be solved with a small lookahead.

However, Asian languages are tokenized using a dedicated segmenter, which cannot be modeled with regular expressions.</p> <p>Now, as a direct result of the new tokenization approach, our new search implementation uses token positions for highlighting, making it exactly as powerful as tokenization:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Word boundaries: as the new highlighter uses token positions, word     boundaries are equal to token boundaries. This means that more complex cases     of tokenization (e.g., case changes, version numbers, HTML/XML tags),     are now all highlighted accurately.</p> </li> <li> <p>Context-awareness: as the new search index preserves some of the     structural information of the original document, the content of a section     is now divided into separate content blocks \u2013 paragraphs, code blocks, and     lists.</p> <p>Now, only the content blocks that actually contain occurrences of one of the search terms are considered for inclusion into the search preview.

With the new tokenization   technique, we laid the groundwork for more sophisticated shortening and   summarization methods, which we're tackling next.</p> </li> <li> <p>User interface improvements: as we now gained full control over the   search plugin, we can now add meaningful metadata to provide more context and   a better experience. We'll explore some of those paths in the future.</p> </li> </ul> <p>If you've made it this far, thank you for your time and interest in Material for MkDocs!

You're invited to leave a comment to share your experiences with the new search implementation.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Prior to  5.0.0, search was carried out in the main thread  which locked up the browser, rendering it unusable. This problem was first reported in #904 and, after some back and forth, fixed and released in  5.0.0.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>At the time of writing, Just the Docs and Docusaurus use this method for generating search previews.

However, the <code>+</code> is completely irrelevant, as regular expression groups involving multiple characters were never supported by lunr's default tokenizer.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Previously, the search query was not correctly tokenized due to the way lunr treats wildcards, as it disables the pipeline for search terms that  contain wildcards. In order to provide a good typeahead experience, Material for MkDocs adds wildcards to the end of each search term not explicitly preceded with <code>+</code> or <code>-</code>, effectively disabling tokenization.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Using the separator as defined in <code>mkdocs.yml</code>, a regular expression was constructed that was trying to mimic the tokenizer. As an example, the search query <code>search highlight</code> was transformed into the rather cumbersome regular expression <code>(^|&lt;separator&gt;)(search|highlight)</code>, which only matches at word boundaries.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Smallest value of ten distinct runs.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>We agnostically use KJV Markdown as a tool for testing to learn how Material for MkDocs behaves on large corpora, as it's a very large set of Markdown files with over 800k words.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"blog/posts/the-past-present-and-future/","title":"The past, present and future","text":"<p>2021 was a fantastic year for this project as we shipped many new awesome features, saw significant user growth and leveraged GitHub Sponsors to make the project sustainable.</p> <p>Today, together, MkDocs and Material for MkDocs are among the most popular options when it comes to choosing a static site generator and theme for your technical documentation project.

I wanted to release my latest Open Source project protobluff, a zero-copy Protocol Buffers implementation for C, which I've created as part of my former startup. As the project has a significant degree of complexity, I quickly realized that I was in need of good user documentation.</p> <p>After evaluating static site generators in general and Hugo, Sphinx and MkDocs in particular, I quickly decided that MkDocs seemed a good choice, as it was specifically aimed at technical project documentation and easy to use. Unfortunately, all of the available themes looked dated and given that I'm a very visual person, I just couldn't convince myself to call it a day.</p> <p>I had to build a theme.</p> <p>Months later, in February 2016, I released the first version of Material for MkDocs (and with it, protobluff, the project I wanted to release in the first place), and it looked like this:</p> <p></p> <p>It was already fully responsive and overall, well, quite okayish, but barely customizable, as only the logo could be changed. Beyond that, it had no options: No color or navigation options, no instant loading, etc. The search was very rudimentary and only supported section titles:</p> <p></p> <p>It's important to know that at this point in time I've built Material for MkDocs for protobluff, the project I was really caring about. Almost 6 years later, nobody knows protobluff, but this little side project has taken off. If back in those days, you would've told me big organizations like AWS, Microsoft and CERN, as well as extremely popular Open Source projects like FastAPI and Kubernetes will be using this project in the future \u2013 I would've declared you insane.</p> <p>I still find the success of this project quite surprising, as I thought that themes exist in abundance and are very much a solved problem. There's no glory in themes, no stars to earn (remember that I was new in Open Source, so this was the metric I was optimizing for), as there are thousands and thousands of options. However, as the years progressed, I learned that execution matters: although Material for MkDocs solves a problem for which thousands of solutions exist, it excels in a specific niche, and that niche is to be known as technical project documentation.</p> <p>Today, this project is not only popular but funded by almost 300 individuals and organizations, resulting in a yearly budget of more than $50,000. This allows me to set aside enough time for the development of new features, bug fixing, stability improvement, issue triage and general support and still feels like a dream to me, as there are many failed stories of Open Source funding and people telling you: don't do Open Source, you'll be working for free.</p> <p>Making Open Source sustainable is, after all, possible in 2021.</p>"},{"location":"blog/posts/the-past-present-and-future/#2021-in-numbers","title":"2021 in numbers","text":"<p>2021 was an exciting year, as the project has seen significant growth.</p> <p>166k people visited the official documentation in 2021, totalling in 1,6m page views which is an increase of 83% when compared to 2020.

As the project grew over time, we found that maintaining and managing the overhead that comes with growth became more challenging and time-consuming.</p> <p>In order to sustain the project and add new and useful features more frequently, we decided to create the Insiders edition, with early access to the latest and greatest features of Material for MkDocs. The subscription-based model of the Insiders edition allows us to dedicate more time and resources to the project, which benefits all  users of Material for MkDocs. Once our funding goals based on monthly  subscriptions are hit, the Insiders features of those^ funding goals are released  to the community edition, letting everyone benefit from them. </p> <p>Maintaining both the community and Insiders editions is an ongoing process, and  we rely on our sponsors to support us on a monthly basis, which makes this whole  project possible.</p> <p>What features are included in the Insiders edition?</p> <p>The Insiders edition includes more than 20 additional features. You can find an  overview of these features on our Insiders page, which is updated when new features are added and released.</p> <p>How often is the Insiders edition updated?</p> <p>We try to keep our open issue count low, fixing known bugs quickly.

You can support Material for MkDocs by sponsoring us on Ko-fi, regardless of whether you have a GitHub account or not. However, please note that Insiders is provided as a private repository on GitHub. If after sponsoring, you'd like to gain access to the repository, you'll need to have a GitHub individual or bot account that can be added as a collaborator. If your organization doesn't use GitHub or/and host its repositories on other platforms, you can mirror the Insiders repository in your environment once you have access.</p> <p>Which sponsoring tier should I choose?</p> <p>The sponsoring tiers are divided into non-commercial and commercial tiers. If  you are an individual or organization using Material for MkDocs for private or non-commercial Open Source projects, you have two tiers to choose from,  depending on the number of sites you want to build. For companies using  Material for MkDocs, we offer three different commercial tiers, from which  you can choose depending on your requirements.</p> <p>Also, please read what is considered commercial use.</p> <p>Why are one-time sponsorships not granted access to Insiders?</p> <p>Primarily due to technical reasons, that we're working on lifting in the future. We use GitHub webhooks to determine our current active sponsors. When you create or cancel your monthly subscription, GitHub sends events that we use to automatically add and remove collaborators.</p> <p>Note that $15 is the minimum amount to be granted access to Insiders.</p> <p>How is my sponsorship contribution used to support the project?</p> <p>Your sponsorship contribution directly supports the development and  maintenance of the project, by buying us maintainers time. It allows us to dedicate more time and resources to enhance the project's features and functionality. The additional funding helps us prioritize improvements and updates, benefiting Insiders users and the wider community. We also actively contribute to other upstream projects, fostering collaboration and giving back to the Open Source ecosystem.</p> <p>Are there any limitations on the number of sponsors for a particular tier?</p> <p>No, there are no limitations on the number of sponsors for any tier.

If you decide to cancel, your sponsorship will remain active until  the end of your billing cycle.</p> <p>What payment options do you accept?</p> <p>We manage all our transactions and sponsorships through GitHub Sponsors and  Ko-fi. To become a sponsor of Material for MkDocs on GitHub, visit  our sponsors' page. On there, you can choose from five different sponsorship  tiers and pay by credit card. Please note that as of the beginning of 2023,  GitHub no longer supports PayPal payments. If you wish to pay with PayPal,  ou can find a selection of our sponsorship tiers on Ko-fi. Both platforms provide you with a payment receipt once your purchase is successful.</p> <p>If you're a company and need assistance choosing the right payment method, please don't hesitate to reach out to sponsors@squidfunk.com.</p> <p>Are discounts available for the Insiders edition, such as student discounts?</p> <p>Unfortunately, we are not able to offer any discounts for the Material for  MkDocs Insiders program. To ensure that everyone can afford the Insiders program  and keep the barrier as low as possible, we have set prices as low as $15 a month for non-commercial use.</p> <p>Do you offer free access to Insiders for Open Source projects?</p> <p>No, we do not offer free access to our Material for MkDocs Insiders edition.  We understand that non-profit organizations may have limited budgets and may  need to prioritize their spending on other projects or organizations. However, it's important to note that Material for MkDocs is maintained by a small team,  investing a lot of time and resources into constantly improving this project.  Material for MkDocs and its core features are free to the community through our  Open Source model. Therefore, Material for MkDocs itself is already free.</p> <p>However, we do offer an affordable sponsorship tier starting at $15 a month,  which is meant for individuals and non-profit organizations using Material for  MkDocs to build 1-2 sites for non-commercial purposes. This tier provides access  to all new features, benefiting you from our ongoing development efforts.</p> <p>Is Insiders free for those who contribute to this project?</p> <p>Great question! We can not offer free access to \"drive-by\" contributors that  only fix minor issues like typos or add new languages. These contributions are  always welcome, but as we need to review them, they result in a higher time  investment from our side and don't compensate for this work. However, as this  project keeps growing, we always seek for individuals to support us. In return,  we offer financial compensation or/and Insiders access. If you are interested  and have experience in the technologies and paradigms listed below, please get in touch with us at sponsors@squidfunk.com:</p> <ul> <li>Deep knowledge of CSS, HTML, TypeScript</li> <li>Experience with progressive enhancement and responsive design</li> <li>Experience with reactive programming with RxJS</li> <li>Solid understanding of Python, MkDocs + ecosystem</li> <li>Solid technical writing skills</li> </ul> <p>Additionally, we're working on a contributor program that will reward contributors that engage in the community by answering questions and helping users with access to Insiders.</p> <p>How can I set my billing to monthly or yearly?</p> <p>You can sponsor Material for MkDocs on a monthly or yearly basis. Depending on  your billing cycle you automatically become a monthly or yearly sponsor. Your  billing cycle is an account-level setting that you can easily change in your  account. If, for some reason, you cannot make this change, you can create a  dedicated bot account with a yearly billing cycle on GitHub, which you only use  for sponsoring (some sponsors already do that). If you have any problems or  further questions, please contact us at sponsors@squidfunk.com.</p> <p>Can I get an invoice for my sponsorship payment?</p> <p>Right now, we can't provide you with an invoice for your sponsoring transaction, as GitHub Sponsors handles all transactions for us. However, both payment platforms, GitHub and Ko-Fi, automatically send you a payment receipt  via mail once the sponsorship is active.</p> <p>Furthermore, we are working on a solution to optimize access management and more features. If you are interested in this, please get in touch with us via mail at sponsors@squidfunk.com or turn on all notifications for MkDocs, and we will reach out as soon as we are live.</p> <p>Can I switch between different sponsoring tiers?</p> <p>Yes, you can switch between different sponsoring tiers at any time. Simply go  to the GitHub Sponsors page and change your sponsoring tier. Once you make  that change, you will immediately change to the new tier.</p> <p>If you change to a higher tier, the amount will be prorated according to your billing cycle.</p> <p>Can I sponsor the project for a specific feature or development goal?</p> <p>While sponsoring specific goals directly is not possible, our sponsoring goals are connected to specific features or development goals aligned with the  project's roadmap. You can find an overview of these sponsoring goals and their  associated features on our website. Insider users have early access to all  already developed features, including those associated with higher funding goals  that will be reached at a later stage. If you're interested in accessing these  features, becoming a sponsor is the way to go. If you have a feature in mind  that you would like to see on the list, we encourage you to  initiate a new discussion to evaluate it with others.</p> <p>What happens if I reach my sponsoring limit for my current tier?</p> <p>If you extend the number of sites that are in your current sponsoring limit,  please upgrade your sponsorship to a higher tier to continue using the  Insiders version and build more sites. The change will be effective immediately.</p> <p>Do you offer refunds for sponsoring payments?</p> <p>Unfortunately, we cannot offer any refund for sponsorship payments.  GitHub Sponsors and Ko-Fi manage all sponsoring transactions. Because of  that, we do not have any insights into the details of the funds and cannot access  them. If you have any payment issues, please get in touch with the GitHub  or Ko-Fi support team, as they can help you.</p>"},{"location":"faq/sponsoring/#access-management","title":"Access management","text":"<p>How do I gain access to the private Insiders repository?</p> <p>If you sponsored with your individual account, you should have received an  email invitation to the private Material for MkDocs Insiders repository right  after you initiated your sponsorship.

We're working on a solution that will allow you to manage collaborator status yourself.</p> <p>Why can't our whole organization get access to Insiders?</p> <p>Currently, it is not possible to grant access to an organizational account, as  GitHub only allows for adding individual user accounts.

If you are working with a team, it is best to create a private fork using the individual account you listed as a collaborator of Material for MkDocs to grant access to all members of your organization to your fork.</p> <p>Can I share my Insiders access with others?</p> <p>At the moment, it is not possible to directly share your collaborator status  for the private Insiders repository with other accounts. However, if you are  working with a team and would like them to access Insiders, you can share the  Insiders repository by utilizing options such as cloning, forking, or  mirroring. By doing so, you can start collaborating with your team members on  the new repository you have shared. This way, you can collectively benefit  from the Insiders features and work together on the project.</p>"},{"location":"faq/sponsoring/#runtime-cancellation","title":"Runtime &amp; cancellation","text":"<p>How long is my sponsorship valid?</p> <p>Your sponsorship is valid for as long as your monthly or yearly subscription is valid.

This includes any use by a corporation or other organization, whether  or not they generate revenue directly from the software. We offer different  pricing tiers for commercial use, each tailored to the needs of different  businesses. It's important to note that internal use of the software within your  organization is also considered commercial use, as with all commercial software.</p> <p>What constitutes non-commercial use of the Insiders version?</p> <p>Non-commercial use of our Material for MkDocs refers to private use. This includes individuals using the Insiders edition for private or purely non-commercial Open Source projects. We offer two different tiers for non-commercial use, depending on the number of sites you want to build.  </p> <p>What is your fair use policy?</p> <p>Our fair use policy includes the following guidelines:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Please refrain from distributing the source code of Insiders. While you  may use the software for public, private, or commercial projects and may  privately fork or mirror it, we ask that you keep the source code private. This  is important to our sponsorware strategy, which helps us fund ongoing  development and support of the software. If this guidelines is violated, everybody loses, as it will reduce the time of us maintainers we can set aside to push this project forward.</p> </li> <li> <p>As our sponsoring tiers are based on the number of sites you want to build,  please make sure to upgrade your sponsorship once your current sponsoring tier  limit has been reached. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Does the Insiders version have a different license?</p> <p>No. Whether you're an individual or a company, you may use Material for  MkDocs Insiders precisely under the same terms as Material for MkDocs, which are  given by the MIT license.</p> <p>Can outside collaborators build and run the documentation locally without access to Insiders?</p> <p>Yes. Insiders is compatible with Material for MkDocs. Almost all new features and configuration options are either backward-compatible or implemented behind feature flags. When working with outside collaborators, changing the general  appearance of your site should be optional. Most Insiders features enhance the  overall experience, e.g., by adding icons to pages or providing a feedback  widget. While these features add value for your site's users, they should be  optional for previewing when making changes to content. Currently, the only  content-related features in Insiders that non-Insiders users can't properly  preview are Annotations and Card grids.</p> <p>This means that outside collaborators can build the documentation locally with  Material for MkDocs, and when they push their changes, your CI pipeline will  build it with Insiders.

GitHub gives you the option to set your sponsorship to private  when you set up your sponsorship. Additionally, we have a recommended workflow  for you: We suggest you create a new GitHub bot account.

There's no glory in themes, no stars to earn (remember that I was new in Open Source, so this was the metric I was optimizing for), as there are thousands and thousands of options. However, as the years progressed, I learned that execution matters: although Material for MkDocs solves a problem for which thousands of solutions exist, it excels in a specific niche, and that niche is to be known as technical project documentation.</p> <p>Today, this project is not only popular but funded by almost 300 individuals and organizations, resulting in a yearly budget of more than $50,000.

As the project grew over time, we found that maintaining and managing the overhead that comes with growth became more challenging and time-consuming.</p> <p>In order to sustain the project and add new and useful features more frequently, we decided to create the Insiders edition, with early access to the latest and greatest features of Material for MkDocs. The subscription-based model of the Insiders edition allows us to dedicate more time and resources to the project, which benefits all  users of Material for MkDocs. Once our funding goals based on monthly  subscriptions are hit, the Insiders features of those^ funding goals are released  to the community edition, letting everyone benefit from them. </p> <p>Maintaining both the community and Insiders editions is an ongoing process, and  we rely on our sponsors to support us on a monthly basis, which makes this whole  project possible.</p> <p>What features are included in the Insiders edition?</p> <p>The Insiders edition includes more than 20 additional features. You can find an  overview of these features on our Insiders page, which is updated when new features are added and released.</p> <p>How often is the Insiders edition updated?</p> <p>We try to keep our open issue count low, fixing known bugs quickly.

You can support Material for MkDocs by sponsoring us on Ko-fi, regardless of whether you have a GitHub account or not. However, please note that Insiders is provided as a private repository on GitHub. If after sponsoring, you'd like to gain access to the repository, you'll need to have a GitHub individual or bot account that can be added as a collaborator. If your organization doesn't use GitHub or/and host its repositories on other platforms, you can mirror the Insiders repository in your environment once you have access.</p> <p>Which sponsoring tier should I choose?</p> <p>The sponsoring tiers are divided into non-commercial and commercial tiers. If  you are an individual or organization using Material for MkDocs for private or non-commercial Open Source projects, you have two tiers to choose from,  depending on the number of sites you want to build. For companies using  Material for MkDocs, we offer three different commercial tiers, from which  you can choose depending on your requirements.</p> <p>Also, please read what is considered commercial use.</p> <p>Why are one-time sponsorships not granted access to Insiders?</p> <p>Primarily due to technical reasons, that we're working on lifting in the future. We use GitHub webhooks to determine our current active sponsors. When you create or cancel your monthly subscription, GitHub sends events that we use to automatically add and remove collaborators.</p> <p>Note that $15 is the minimum amount to be granted access to Insiders.</p> <p>How is my sponsorship contribution used to support the project?</p> <p>Your sponsorship contribution directly supports the development and  maintenance of the project, by buying us maintainers time. It allows us to dedicate more time and resources to enhance the project's features and functionality. The additional funding helps us prioritize improvements and updates, benefiting Insiders users and the wider community. We also actively contribute to other upstream projects, fostering collaboration and giving back to the Open Source ecosystem.</p> <p>Are there any limitations on the number of sponsors for a particular tier?</p> <p>No, there are no limitations on the number of sponsors for any tier.

If you decide to cancel, your sponsorship will remain active until  the end of your billing cycle.</p> <p>What payment options do you accept?</p> <p>We manage all our transactions and sponsorships through GitHub Sponsors and  Ko-fi. To become a sponsor of Material for MkDocs on GitHub, visit  our sponsors' page. On there, you can choose from five different sponsorship  tiers and pay by credit card. Please note that as of the beginning of 2023,  GitHub no longer supports PayPal payments. If you wish to pay with PayPal,  ou can find a selection of our sponsorship tiers on Ko-fi.

To ensure that everyone can afford the Insiders program  and keep the barrier as low as possible, we have set prices as low as $15 a month for non-commercial use.</p> <p>Do you offer free access to Insiders for Open Source projects?</p> <p>No, we do not offer free access to our Material for MkDocs Insiders edition.  We understand that non-profit organizations may have limited budgets and may  need to prioritize their spending on other projects or organizations. However, it's important to note that Material for MkDocs is maintained by a small team,  investing a lot of time and resources into constantly improving this project.  Material for MkDocs and its core features are free to the community through our  Open Source model. Therefore, Material for MkDocs itself is already free.</p> <p>However, we do offer an affordable sponsorship tier starting at $15 a month,  which is meant for individuals and non-profit organizations using Material for  MkDocs to build 1-2 sites for non-commercial purposes. This tier provides access  to all new features, benefiting you from our ongoing development efforts.</p> <p>Is Insiders free for those who contribute to this project?</p> <p>Great question! We can not offer free access to \"drive-by\" contributors that  only fix minor issues like typos or add new languages. These contributions are  always welcome, but as we need to review them, they result in a higher time  investment from our side and don't compensate for this work. However, as this  project keeps growing, we always seek for individuals to support us. In return,  we offer financial compensation or/and Insiders access.

Depending on  your billing cycle you automatically become a monthly or yearly sponsor. Your  billing cycle is an account-level setting that you can easily change in your  account. If, for some reason, you cannot make this change, you can create a  dedicated bot account with a yearly billing cycle on GitHub, which you only use  for sponsoring (some sponsors already do that). If you have any problems or  further questions, please contact us at sponsors@squidfunk.com.</p> <p>Can I get an invoice for my sponsorship payment?</p> <p>Right now, we can't provide you with an invoice for your sponsoring transaction, as GitHub Sponsors handles all transactions for us. However, both payment platforms, GitHub and Ko-Fi, automatically send you a payment receipt  via mail once the sponsorship is active.</p> <p>Furthermore, we are working on a solution to optimize access management and more features. If you are interested in this, please get in touch with us via mail at sponsors@squidfunk.com or turn on all notifications for MkDocs, and we will reach out as soon as we are live.</p> <p>Can I switch between different sponsoring tiers?</p> <p>Yes, you can switch between different sponsoring tiers at any time. Simply go  to the GitHub Sponsors page and change your sponsoring tier. Once you make  that change, you will immediately change to the new tier.</p> <p>If you change to a higher tier, the amount will be prorated according to your billing cycle.</p> <p>Can I sponsor the project for a specific feature or development goal?</p> <p>While sponsoring specific goals directly is not possible, our sponsoring goals are connected to specific features or development goals aligned with the  project's roadmap. You can find an overview of these sponsoring goals and their  associated features on our website. Insider users have early access to all  already developed features, including those associated with higher funding goals  that will be reached at a later stage. If you're interested in accessing these  features, becoming a sponsor is the way to go. If you have a feature in mind  that you would like to see on the list, we encourage you to  initiate a new discussion to evaluate it with others.</p> <p>What happens if I reach my sponsoring limit for my current tier?</p> <p>If you extend the number of sites that are in your current sponsoring limit,  please upgrade your sponsorship to a higher tier to continue using the  Insiders version and build more sites. The change will be effective immediately.</p> <p>Do you offer refunds for sponsoring payments?</p> <p>Unfortunately, we cannot offer any refund for sponsorship payments.  GitHub Sponsors and Ko-Fi manage all sponsoring transactions. Because of  that, we do not have any insights into the details of the funds and cannot access  them.

For now, to ensure that  access is not tied to a particular individual, we recommend creating a bot  account, i.e., a GitHub account that does not belong to a specific individual  but is listed as the owner of the organizational account and using this account  for sponsorship.</p> <p>Do I need to fork the repository to use it?</p> <p>It depends. If you are using the Insiders edition as an individual, you can work directly with the private repository, as you do not need to share the Insiders features with others. If you are working with a team, it is best to create a private fork using the individual account you listed as a collaborator of Material for MkDocs to grant access to all members of your organization to your fork.</p> <p>Can I share my Insiders access with others?</p> <p>At the moment, it is not possible to directly share your collaborator status  for the private Insiders repository with other accounts. However, if you are  working with a team and would like them to access Insiders, you can share the  Insiders repository by utilizing options such as cloning, forking, or  mirroring. By doing so, you can start collaborating with your team members on  the new repository you have shared. This way, you can collectively benefit  from the Insiders features and work together on the project.</p>"},{"location":"v10/faq/sponsoring/#runtime-cancellation","title":"Runtime &amp; cancellation","text":"<p>How long is my sponsorship valid?</p> <p>Your sponsorship is valid for as long as your monthly or yearly subscription is valid.

This includes any use by a corporation or other organization, whether  or not they generate revenue directly from the software. We offer different  pricing tiers for commercial use, each tailored to the needs of different  businesses. It's important to note that internal use of the software within your  organization is also considered commercial use, as with all commercial software.</p> <p>What constitutes non-commercial use of the Insiders version?</p> <p>Non-commercial use of our Material for MkDocs refers to private use. This includes individuals using the Insiders edition for private or purely non-commercial Open Source projects. We offer two different tiers for non-commercial use, depending on the number of sites you want to build.  </p> <p>What is your fair use policy?</p> <p>Our fair use policy includes the following guidelines:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Please refrain from distributing the source code of Insiders. While you  may use the software for public, private, or commercial projects and may  privately fork or mirror it, we ask that you keep the source code private. This  is important to our sponsorware strategy, which helps us fund ongoing  development and support of the software. If this guidelines is violated, everybody loses, as it will reduce the time of us maintainers we can set aside to push this project forward.</p> </li> <li> <p>As our sponsoring tiers are based on the number of sites you want to build,  please make sure to upgrade your sponsorship once your current sponsoring tier  limit has been reached. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Does the Insiders version have a different license?</p> <p>No. Whether you're an individual or a company, you may use Material for  MkDocs Insiders precisely under the same terms as Material for MkDocs, which are  given by the MIT license.</p> <p>Can outside collaborators build and run the documentation locally without access to Insiders?</p> <p>Yes. Insiders is compatible with Material for MkDocs. Almost all new features and configuration options are either backward-compatible or implemented behind feature flags. When working with outside collaborators, changing the general  appearance of your site should be optional. Most Insiders features enhance the  overall experience, e.g., by adding icons to pages or providing a feedback  widget. While these features add value for your site's users, they should be  optional for previewing when making changes to content. Currently, the only  content-related features in Insiders that non-Insiders users can't properly  preview are Annotations and Card grids.</p> <p>This means that outside collaborators can build the documentation locally with  Material for MkDocs, and when they push their changes, your CI pipeline will  build it with Insiders. When using built-in plugins exclusive to Insiders, it's  recommended to split configuration into a base <code>mkdocs.yml</code> and one with plugin  overrides via configuration inheritance.</p> <p>See the getting started guide for more information.</p>"},{"location":"v10/faq/sponsoring/#support","title":"Support","text":"<p>How can I contact support if I have questions about becoming a sponsor? </p> <p>If you have any questions and would like to contact us before starting your  sponsorship, we are happy to answer all your non-technical questions about the  Insiders program via email at sponsors@squidfunk.com.</p> <p>All technical questions should be asked openly on our discussion board.</p> <p>Is additional support available for Material for MkDocs Insiders users?</p> <p>Yes, we provide non-technical support related to sponsoring at sponsors@squidfunk.com.
