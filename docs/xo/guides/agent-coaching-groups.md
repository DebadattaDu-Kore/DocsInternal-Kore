# Agent Coaching


## Introduction

As a contact center supervisor, you may want to view all the triggered utterances, the number of times each utterance is triggered, and the agent’s adherence to the action in a selected timeframe.

The Agent Coaching feature lets you configure utterance-based, real-time coaching. You can configure relevant utterances so that when they occur, AgentAssist performs relevant actions such as nudge, hint, and email manager action. This document explains everything about the Agent Coaching feature, including groups, rules, rule triggers, and rule actions.

This document is meant for the contact center supervisors.



## Create, Edit, and Delete Groups

The Agent Coaching groups are sets of rules for coaching the contact center agents. You create these groups to categorize a particular functionality or segregate all the related issues. For example, all the rules dealing with pricing may come under a group named Pricing. In this section, you will learn everything about creating, editing, and deleting groups.


### Creating a New Group

With more and more issues and situations arising that have common or related solutions, it is important to group them so that you get relevant answers. The Agent Coaching feature allows you to create new groups as and when required.

1. Log in to the **AgentAssist** UI.
2. From the top menu, click **Configuration**.
3. Click **Agent** **Coaching** from the left menu. The **Agent Coaching** page is displayed with pre-existing groups, if any.
