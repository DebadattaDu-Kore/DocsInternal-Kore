# **Usage Plans**

	

		

			

Usage Plans help you manage your bots and workspaces while keeping track of their periodic billing and usage. On the analytics-driven **Plan & Usage** dashboard, you can view the conversations volume and billing on a daily or monthly basis. You can also track free credits usage, add funds to your account, and manage auto payments in a single place.

When you sign up on the Platform, the Kore.ai XO Platform associates all the workspaces with a default Standard Plan. A Standard Plan offers a pay-as-you-go model that supports eCommerce flexible and customized journeys for enterprises to launch virtual assistants. You can select a standard plan that comes with self-service features, or upgrade to a customized Enterprise Plan that offers “Enterprise-grade” features by[ contacting](https://kore.ai/services/) our service team.

We’ve put much thought into our usage plans so you can explore the Platform effortlessly and extensively based on your business and pricing goals. This is an essential element of our product-led growth approach for eCommerce customers.

The following plans are currently available on the latest version of the Kore.ai XO Platform:


## **Standard Plan**

As a new user, you get free credits worth \$500 at the workspace level, which you can share among the Virtual Assistants in the workspace. The plan follows **Conversation-based billing** where each conversation handled by a Bot linked to your account is billed at a unit price of $ 0.2, deducted from your free credits (if available), otherwise paid credits balance.

		

	

    **Definition**: A conversation is an interaction with the bot for any length with no more than 15 minutes of inactivity.



You can leverage the[ basic features](https://developer.kore.ai/docs/bots/bot-settings/plan-usage/usage-plans/#Usage_Plan_Features) for your bots with a Standard Plan.

		

	

	

		

			

A Standard Plan’s key features include the following:



1. If a conversation ends with 15 minutes of inactivity, and the interaction starts again, it is considered a new conversation and billed.
2. Conversations-based Billing: The Standard Plan billing is done on the basis of the following primary units types:
    * **Number of Conversations**: The number of conversations considered as a billing unit. If the interaction starts again after 15 minutes of inactivity, it is considered a new conversation for billing.
    * **Proactive Notifications**: The number of event-based system notifications triggered on the Platform to the account owner.
    * **Alert Notifications**: The number of system alerts triggered on the Platform to the account owner. For example, Free Credits expiry alerts.
1. Free Credit Expires in 90 days: By default, a new workspace is created as a Standard Workspace and gets initial free credit of $500. The free credit expires in 90 days from the workspace creation date or the credit assignment date.

When Free credits expire, the following happen:



1. Any remaining free credits get lapsed (are treated as zero balance) and cannot be used anymore.
2. The free credits expiry impacts the utilization of credits, triggers low balance or zero balance emails, and highlights low or zero balance in the system warnings and messages.
3. The number of free credits that lapsed on expiry displays on the account owner’s dashboard.

		


        **Important**: For an existing Standard Workspace, the remaining or unutilized free credit will expire in 90 days from the release date of this policy – March 19, 2023.

	

		

			


### **Free Credits Utilization**

The usage deduction from the paid balance starts only after the free credits are fully utilized or expired. This ensures that the Free Credits available can be used before they expire.

Here are other important considerations:



1. You can use free credits as required for one or more multiple virtual assistants mapped to your account/workspace.
2. You must add funds and purchase paid credits to ensure that a Virtual Assistant (VA) does not stop responding if free credits are consumed collectively by all the VAs.
3. For a Standard Account, all the conversations for all the virtual assistants are considered and deducted from the available free credits.
4. Multiple payment methods like ACH or Wire Transfer, in addition to Credit Cards, are available for paid credits.
5. You can track the Free Credits usage on the[ Usage Plan Dashboard](https://developer.kore.ai/docs/bots/bot-settings/plan-usage/usage-plans/#Usage_Plan_Dashboard).


### **Add Paid Credits**

To ensure that your Virtual Assistants in the Workspace respond after your Free Credits have exhausted or expired, you must add **Paid Credits**. The minimum top-up amount is **$100**.

The important considerations to add Paid Credits to a Virtual Assistant (Standard Workspace) are given below:



1. You can add paid credits to a particular virtual assistant from the Builder at any time in one of the following ways:
    * Add paid credits before the virtual assistant is published.
    * Add paid credits even if the workspace has free credits.
1. The Platform uses the Paid Credits only when the Free Credits have exhausted.
2. The paid credits can be mapped to the designated virtual assistant or shared among other VAs in the workspace.


## **Enterprise Plan**

The **Enterprise Plan** is available for all the instances of the Kore.ai XO Platform (Global, EU, and JP). It is a pay-as-you-go plan that supports enterprise bots with high volume interactions and enterprise administration needs. The plan follows a **Session-based billing** model where a **Session** is the billing unit clocked for 15 minutes of interaction with the bot. It includes both active interactions and inactivity. You can leverage the[ basic features](https://developer.kore.ai/docs/bots/bot-settings/plan-usage/usage-plans/#Usage_Plan_Features) for your bots with an Enterprise Plan.

The important features include the following:



* Every **15 minutes** of user interaction with the virtual assistant is billed as a **session**.
* The Enterprise Plan can be customized to your business needs. Please[ contact](https://kore.ai/contact-us/) the Kore AI support team for more information.
* To initiate a Custom Enterprise Plan subscription, you must create a contract with the Kore.ai Team.
* The real-time billing usage data of your Enterprise Virtual Assistant is available on the **Plan & Usage** page.
* As a Workspace owner, you can view and manage your bot usage and balance by clicking the **Manage** menu item.

    * If you select **Custom**, the date range for daily aggregation cannot exceed 90 days.
* **Monthly**
    * Select this aggregation type to view the usage trends of conversations consumed each month for the selected date range. By default, the system displays the monthly aggregation graph for the previous month. You can explicitly select any other month(s) to view the information.
    * The system allows to select 1 month, 2 months, or 3 months date ranges.
    8 If you select **Custom**, the date range for monthly aggregation cannot exceed 365 days.
* **Billing Units** 
The Enterprise Plan billing is done on the basis of the following primary units types: 

    * **Number of Sessions**: The number of sessions consumed by a bot linked to the enterprise workspace. The aggregate of all the sessions consumed by all the bots in the workspace reflect on the enterprise workspace owner’s dashboard.
    * **Proactive Notifications**: The number of event-based system notifications triggered on the Platform to the account owner.
    * **Alert Notifications**: The number of system alerts triggered on the Platform to the account owner.
