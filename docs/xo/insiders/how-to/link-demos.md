how do different kind of links going to work?

1. Open link from image [![Mushroom](../mushroom.png)](https://www.pngwing.com/en/free-png-duoxo) 
2. [Open link through text](https://developer.kore.ai/docs/bots/how-tos/update-booking-task/) 
3. <a href="https://developer.kore.ai/uncategorised/change-flight-task/" target="_blank">Open link in new tab</a>
4. Some [Knowledge Graph](https://developer.kore.ai/uncategorised/build-a-travel-assistant-knowledge-graph/) FAQs along with relevant structure that lets your VA reply to usersâ€™ questions, initiate tasks and detect intents appropriately.
