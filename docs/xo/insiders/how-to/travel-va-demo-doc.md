# **Travel Assistant Overview**

The Kore.ai XO Platform allows you to create a variety of Virtual Assistants, to suit business needs that are just as diverse. In this section of the Platform’s Documentation, we will explore a use case that will help you gain more in-depth knowledge about building specific scenarios within your VA. For this purpose, we will build a Travel Planning Assistant and focus on several essential topics, which we will be discussing below: 


# Designing Conversation Skills

Conversation skills are central to your VA, since they make the functionality possible. In this section of our Use Case Documentation, you will learn how to create the following:



1. A simple [Travel Planning Assistant](https://developer.kore.ai/docs/bots/how-tos/travel-planing-assistant/create-a-travel-virtual-assistant/), with a _Check Flight Status_ Dialog Task.
2. An [Update Booking Dialog Task](https://developer.kore.ai/docs/bots/how-tos/update-booking-task/) that allows users to update the name on their travel booking. 
3. A [Change Flight Task](https://developer.kore.ai/uncategorised/change-flight-task/) that lets users change flights by providing the flights to change from and to, as well as the seat preference.
4. Some [Knowledge Graph](https://developer.kore.ai/uncategorised/build-a-travel-assistant-knowledge-graph/) FAQs along with relevant structure that lets your VA reply to users’ questions, initiate tasks and detect intents appropriately. 
5. A [Smart Alert](https://developer.kore.ai/docs/bots/how-tos/travel-planing-assistant/schedule-a-smart-alert/) that sends users weather forecasts.
