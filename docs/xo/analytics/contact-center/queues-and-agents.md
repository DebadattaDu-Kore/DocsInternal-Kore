# **Overview of Incoming Conversations**

This section displays the metrics for all conversations (phone, chat, and email):



* Total Conversations – Total conversation count for the selected time range.
* In Queue – Count conversations in a queue.
* Ongoing – Count of ongoing conversations.
* Idle – Count of Idle conversations.
* Expired – Count of expired conversations.
* Closed – Count of closed conversations.

COMPARE: The COMPARE switch compares all historical metrics over a previous equal-sized time range. For example, if the Average Handle Time is 12m 2s for the last 30 days the previous Average Handle Time was 6m 1s. If you click Compare, an increase of 50% over the last 30 days will be displayed.

Transfer Rate – Percentage of transferred conversations.

Abandon Rate – Percentage of abandoned conversations.

Clicking the percentage value on the Abandon Rate widget shows the following information:



* “Abandoned while in Queue” – Count of conversations (NNNN) that were abandoned while waiting in the queue.
* “Abandoned while with Agent” – Count of conversations (NNNN) that where abandoned while being attended by an Agent.

![alt_text](images/image20.png "image_tooltip")


The formula for measuring the Abandon Count:



* For Digital Channels: 
Abandon Count = User Abandons While Waiting in Queue + Conversations With Agent that went through the Idle-Expired Sequence.
* For Voice Channels:
Abandon Count = User Abandons While Waiting in Queue + Conversations With Agent where User Disconnects While Agent has put the call on hold.

Overdue – This live metric shows the number of conversations currently in the overdue state. It displays the number based on all the conversations currently associated with the selected queues and agents.

System Terminations: Count of conversations that were terminated by the System. This metric is shown based on selected queues only. Clicking on the number displays the details of the system terminations.

Average Speed to Answer – The average time it takes an agent to respond to a conversation assigned to them.

Average Handling Time – The average handling time of the conversations.

Queue Load – Displays the current load on the system as a percentage of its capacity. This is a live metric.

Resolved Rate – Percentage of resolved conversations.
