# **Digital Views**

Interactions with Virtual Assistants are typically conducted using chat/messaging tools, voice channels, or other types of assistants. In the majority of the cases, the Virtual Assistants respond to the user queries only when the users have requested some information. This works well for conducting on-demand tasks that need user input for execution and the result is usually a short response, confirmation, or acknowledgment. But the need for more proactive user updates and less user input through an engaging interface has become a key requirement. 

Using **Digital Views** from the Kore.ai XO Platform, you can design and launch rich visual experiences through interactive components, panels, and widgets, to proactively present relevant information to your users or customers. **Panels** are the placeholders that hold one or more widgets. **Widgets** are individual components that display information to the end-users. Your users or customers can interact with your VA either in conversation mode or directly get the required information from the widgets.

This article gives an overview on the working and implementation of **Panels & Widgets**. For step-by-step usage instructions, [refer to this article](https://developer.kore.ai/docs/bots/how-tos/how-to-configure-digital-views/).


## How It Works 

1. Using Digital Views, an organization offers to its VA end-users a single interface for various activities.
2. Multiple panels constitute a Digital View.
3. Each of the panels gives access to various functions.
4. The end-user accesses these panels for information pertaining to each of the functions and performs follow-up actions.
5. As an example, a Panel within a travel VA  could have multiple widgets showing:
    * Upcoming Trips
    * Completed Bookings
    * Canceled Bookings
    ![access digital views](../use-cases/images/access-digitalviews.png "access digital views")

You can access Digital Views by selecting the VA you want to work with then going to **Build > Digital Skills > Digital Views**. 

## How to use Digital Views?

You can enable Digital Views for your Virtual Assistant by designing the required widgets, adding them to the relevant panels and publishing them on the WidgetSDK channel.

Here are the steps we recommend for efficient design of Digital Views: 

1. **Set up**: Panels are containers to host one or more widgets. You may create multiple panels and each panel can host widgets that present relevant information. Widgets are the interactive components that can contain information to be presented to the end-users and allow them to perform actions and follow-ups.
2. **Configure**: Define widgets by connecting them either to your tasks or by directly defining the widget. If you have connected your widget to a Dialog Task, make sure to use a Message node to present the required information in the widget using any of the supported widget templates.
3. **Preview & Publish**: Preview your widgets from the XO Platform to review the visual representation of the information. Enable the WidgetSDK channel and publish your panels and widgets to make them available for your end-users.
4. **Host with Kore.ai SDK / Host Independently**: You can choose to host your widgets independently or co-host them along with the WebSDK. You can download the SDKs from the [Kore.ai GitHub page](https://github.com/Koredotcom/web-kore-sdk).

## General Setup

Here is the general setup process to follow when you want to configure Panels and Widgets for Digital Views: 

1. **Configure Widgets**: Define widgets by connecting them either to your tasks or any other source like JavaScript generating JSON file. In cases where you are using a task as a source, ensure that the message is formatted properly for the Widget SDK channel.
2. **Preview the Widgets**: Preview your widgets from the XO Platform.
3. **Set up Panels**: You may create multiple panels and each panel can host widgets that present relevant information. You can use the predefined widgets or create new ones.
4. **Test the Panels** to see how the Panels and Widgets are rendered in the chat window.
5. **Publish the VA**: Publish the VAso that the panels and widgets are made available for your end-users.
6. **Host the Panel**: You can choose to host your widgets independently or co-host them along with the web SDK. You can download the SDKs from the Kore.ai GitHub page. Do ensure to enable WidgetSDK as a channel.


## Configure Widgets

Widgets are individual components that can communicate with the VA for presenting information to the end-users. The source of information for widgets is from a Dialog Task or a JSON using any of the predefined widget templates.

To configure widgets, follow the below steps:

1. Click **Create Widget** to create a widget.
![create widget](../use-cases/images/create-widget.png "create widget")

2. The New Widget dialog opens.
![new widget dialog](../use-cases/images/new-widget-dialog.png "new widget dialog")

3. On the **New Widget** window, enter the following details:
    * **Name** of the widget
    * **Display Name** for the widget
    * **Auto Refresh** to set the frequency with which this widget needs a poll for fresh data. The refresh is applicable only when the panel containing the widget is active.
    * **Source** for a widget can be set either from the execution of Dialog Task, from JavaScript by defining a JSON, or by linking an existing Digital Form.
4. Click **Save**.

### Configure Widget Sources

For the widget input data, you must configure one of the following sources and complete the configuration.

### Dialog Task

The **Dialog Task** option allows you to trigger a task and present the output in the widget.

The **Select Dialog Task** drop-down will list all available tasks in the current VA. Select the task you want to trigger using this widget.

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>In the connected Dialog Task make sure to use a Message node to present the required information in the widget using any of the supported widget templates.</p>
</div>

You can use the icon next to the Dialog Task to open the Dialog Task for checking the task details like entity names etc.

Any entities used by the selected Dialog Task need to be pre-populated with values by mapping **Entity Name** with **Entity Values**.

If the selected Dialog Task has any **Authorization Profile** defined, it is displayed here.
![dialog task source](../use-cases/images/dialog-task-source.png "dialog task source")

### JSON

When selecting JSON as the source, you will be presented with a Javascript editor, where you can add your code, as shown below:
![json file upload](../use-cases/images/json-source-file.png "json file upload")

### Digital Form

When selecting **Digital Form** as a widget source, you  can select the Digital Form, and the Dialog Task to trigger on submission.

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>A Digital Form can be used to define multiple Widgets and can also be added to multiple Panels. However, it will be associated with the same Dialog Task across all Widgets and Panels.

</div>

### Edit, Run & Preview a Widget

After you save, the widget will be **In Development **state. You can **Edit** or **Delete** the widget.
![widget saved](../use-cases/images/widget-saved.png "widget saved")

When you select **Edit** widget, apart from being able to modify any of the above fields, you will have the option to **Run & Preview** the widget. You can save the preview as the thumbnail display for the widget.
