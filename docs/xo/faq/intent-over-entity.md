How does Intent Over Entity work?

[Intent](https://developer.kore.ai/docs/bots/chatbot-overview/about-bots/#I) over [Entity](https://developer.kore.ai/docs/bots/chatbot-overview/about-bots/#E) is a bot-level setting configured on the [Dialog Task](https://developer.kore.ai/docs/bots/chatbot-overview/about-bots/#D) to prioritize a customerâ€™s intent. The bot understands the intention behind the customer's input. By focusing on the intent, the system quickly determines the customer's requirements and the desired outcome, and provides more efficient and effective responses.

There are two options for configuration:

1. **Intent over Entity**: The ongoing intent automatically terminates, initiating a new dialogue. For example: If a customer intends to place an order and during the interaction changes their intent and requests to edit the order, the system terminates the ongoing intent (place order) and initiates a new intent (edit order).

2. **Entity over Intent**: The ongoing dialogue task proceeds normally, considering the customer input as an entity value, and allows the dialogue task to progress to the next node. For example: If a customer intends to place an order and during the interaction changes their intent and requests to edit the order, the system continues with the ongoing intent to place the order.
